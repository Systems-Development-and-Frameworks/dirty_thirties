## Exercise 8

| Deadline                   | Date                   |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Final Due date**         | **03.02.2021 - 14:00** |


### GOAL

In this exercise we practice how to implement a design specification given in the form of an image or document. You do not necessarily have to extend exercise 1-7 (this is optional, see [Optional Objectives](#optional-objectives)). Make it clear in your Pull Requests how we can build and test your solution. 

The goal is to implement a simplified [Holy Grail layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_(web_design)) with a header, content and footer section. Header and content must be responsive. It is advised to make use of [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) for responsiveness and [CSS grids](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) for the layout.

## Installation instructions

Go in folder design
```
To install the dependencies via npm:
```
$ npm install
```
serve with hot reload in dev mode
```
$ npm dev
```
build for production and launch server:
```
npm run build
```
npm run generate
```
npm run start
```

## Objectives

:star: For a responsive content section (3-column vs 1-column layout)

:star: For responsive content items (1-column vs. 2-column layout)
