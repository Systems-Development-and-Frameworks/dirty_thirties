# Exercise #4

| Deadline                   | Date                   |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Review due date (optional) | 02.12.2020 - 14:00     |
| **Final Due date**         | **09.12.2020 - 14:00** |

## Goal

In this exercise, you're going to learn the concepts of [Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) with [JWT](https://jwt.io/) and [Authorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization) with [graphql-shield](https://github.com/maticzav/graphql-shield). For the latter, you need an understanding of the "middleware" software pattern as defined by [express](https://github.com/maticzav/graphql-shield). An implementation for [apollo-server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server) is [graphql-middleware](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-middleware).

Extend exercise [#1](../1), [#2](../2) and [#3](../3) with the new [objectives](#objectives).
